Common-Data-Model / BigQuery
=================

This folder contains the OMOP CDM ddl script for Google BigQuery. It makes use of the #standardSql option. *PLEASE NOTE* this dialect is not fully supported, meaning it has not been tested. This script was created by running the Sql Server ddl through [SqlRender](https://github.com/ohdsi/sqlrender) in order to translate it to BigQuery and it may not have accounted for all idiosyncrasies.
