Common-Data-Model / Netezza
=================

This folder contains the script for Netezza. *PLEASE NOTE* this dialect is not fully supported, meaning it has not been tested. This script was created by running the Sql Server ddl through [SqlRender](https://github.com/ohdsi/sqlrender) in order to translate it to Netezza and it may not have accounted for all idiosyncrasies.
